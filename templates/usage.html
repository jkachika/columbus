                        the Columbus Control Panel. Administrators can use this page install or upgrade worker software
                        selectively to the needed machines, monitor the state of each worker machine, or even record
                        the activity of each machine. There is a high scope of improvement here but it can help with
                        basic administrative things getting done.
